# Air Pollution in the Tristate & Nationwide: Trends & Health Effects

Continued from project 1, we researched trends in outdoor air quality measures based on established air quality indicators from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in Tristate and Nationwide. We created data visualizations using Stacked Bar, Multi-Series Line Charts, Pie Charts, and Geo-Mapping.

Key Questions:

How do the trends for Air Quality Indicators (AQIs) for the tristate area over the last 40 years compare to nationwide rates?
In the tristate area, do any specfic counties have drastic changes over the past 40 years?
How do the specific air pollutant gases differ in other states in comparison to the tristate area?

Background:

Clean Air Act was passed in 1963, with amendments in 1970 and 1990. 
Air pollution is associated with several health effects, particularly respiratory illness.
Air quality measurements for the tristate area (NY, NJ, CT) have not consistently met the U.S. EPA  National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)

Methods:

EPA AQI Data
EPA Individual air pollutant data (gases)
(Limitations:  Used data available. Note: all years and/or locations not available for all datasets)
Utilized zip_download function to download the large datasets for data more than a decade
Utilized Javascript to make a map with leaflet.js geo-mapping capabilities to visually compare AQI levels from 1980 and 2018.
